# The_Room

Line 270 doesn't seem to prevent player input, and the new status is not 
printed aferwards.

The player doesn't die after time is up in shoot() function

We need more pictures to go with the other rooms - Lines 128 & 129

I added a puzzle for the safe,

I added a new room, r7, which is a prison you wake up in and you can't move until you uncuff yourself. It isn't very complicated but maybe we can change that later. -createRooms(self)
Also if you know how to set a response as soon as the game is launched stating that the player is handcuffed could we do that? that way it what is happening is clearer to the player.

I added a puzzle that is; take the purple key from the foyer and box from the study and unlock the box, place the gem in the north most room to get a key for the secret door, place the book on the bookshelves, use the red key on the door, take the paper slip with a code written on it from the closet, unlock the safe with the code, take the gem inside and place it above the fireplace, that is the key required to end the game after killing the dragon. If it's too much or not enough or something I can change it.

added a function to examine objects in the player's inventory might be a good addition to the actions -line 270
