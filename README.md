# The_Room

Line 265 doesn't seem to prevent player input, and the new status is not

The player doesn't die after time is up in shoot() function

We need more pictures to go with the other rooms - Lines 128 & 129

There is a safe in the secret room that is revealed when the book is placed on 
the bookshelf. It was the beginning of a puzzle that I never finished, so I 
guess we should hide a code somewhere. - line 163

I added a new room, r7, which is a prison you wake up in and you can't move until you uncuff yourself. It isn't very complicated but maybe -createRooms(self)

I am also adding a puzzle involving color coded keys that will eventually unlock the door behind the bookcase. The statue and the fireplace also has a reason to exist as they are a part of the puzzle.
